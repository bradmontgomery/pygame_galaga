# pygame_galaga

#DESCRIPTION#
This is an attempt to create a replica of the Galaga arcade game in Python 3, using the Pygame library. It's a little more akin to Galaxian
in its current form.

#BACKSTORY#
This started as a throwaway experiment in Pygame, but has become a pretty rewarding project for me. A little background on me,
I've been coding in some form around 12-13 years. My first experiences with code were using a program called Game Maker, a drag+drop
tool to let you build games. For advanced users, it also had its own language called GML.
