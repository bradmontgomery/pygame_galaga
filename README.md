We have Galaga at home!

This is an attempt to re-create the Galaga arcade game using Python and Pygame. It's closer to Space Invaders or Galaxian in its current
form. I will continue to work on this project, but wanted to offer it as a platform for you to build and expand.


Things that have not been done (in no particular order):
1. Sounds - There are none. I have some in the resources folder to use
2. High Score - It is not saved at all. It's not very fun if your progress disappears each time you close the game!
3. Two Player - The real Galaga allows two players to take turns blasting enemies and getting points. Consider allowing this, but make
		sure not to mix up the two player's points!
4. Enemy entrance and formations - The real Galaga has enemies enter from off-screen and join into a formation. They then take turns
				   flying down and shooting at the player
5. Challenge stages - These allow the player to shoot at enemy formations as they quickly pass by. The player earns extra points for
		      destroying all enemies
6. Gaining extra lifes - You gain an extra life at 20000 pts, 70000 pts, and then every 70k after that. Maybe test this with lower scores
			 to decrease your testing time :)

I'm sure there are many more! I've tried to resolve all the bugs and crashes encountered, but I'm not promising it's perfect.
Please share your progress with me via Slack or email (trey@tech901.org). I don't care how long after class it is, I want to hear from you!
